# CowledMenace
Someone has been working in the shadows, manipulating events on the Sword Coast to their advantage.

Unravel the mysteries of the Twisted Rune and investigate the Cowled Wizards in this Enhanced Edition Trilogy mod!

## Compatibility
This mod requires the mod [Enhanced Edition Trilogy](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/195-enhanced-edition-trilogy/) by k4thos to be installed, as its content spans from Baldur's Gate 1 to Throne of Bhaal.

The optional components only require BG2 to be installed.

In general, this mod should be installed after NPC mods and EET, but before Tweaks and EET_end.

## Thanks and Acknowledgements 

Special Thanks to demivrgvs, Roxanne, kreso, DavidW, CamDawg, Nythrun & Miloch (area patching) and every helpful fellow on gibberlings3 forums!

Huge thanks to [klatu](http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/1109-klatu-tweaks-and-fixes/), I based many of my code on his tweaks. Because the Cowled Wizards are heavily implicated in my mod, the main component installs a modified version of his "Appropriate XP Rewards for Cowled Enforcers" tweak. Many thanks also to the creators of the Infinity Engine Structure Description Project; and to Jon Hauglid, for Near Infinity.

And of course, thanks to k4thos for making the [Enhanced Edition Trilogy](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/195-enhanced-edition-trilogy/).
