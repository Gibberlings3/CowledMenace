## Spoilers Section

Don't read this if you don't want to get spoiled! One of the fun parts of this mod is having to investigate the Twisted Rune, which you won't have to do if you know exactly where to go, all the time. But if you're stuck, this is how to progress...

## Rough Walkthrough

### Baldur's Gate 1 *(optional)*
Acquire a Rogue Stone (you can find one in South-east BG, Gantolandan's house) and head to Baldur's Gate East, to the last house on the left, south-west of Sorcerous Sundries (the one with the rotting door). Stand next to the door with a Rogue Stone, and it should teleport you in a Twisted Rune enclave, similar to the Athkatla one. There, you will face a hard battle, designed to be impossible to complete at this point outside of epic cheese strategies. Assuming you win, you will meet a friend afterwards who will point you toward Athkatla. This part is entirely optional as you can come back later to complete it. The quest is continued in BG2.

### Baldur's Gate 2
Start by going into the Graveyard District, top-right corner. You will meet someone there.

Those of you who are familar with the Twisted Rune will already know how to enter the Twisted Rune area, but here's how you normally progress through the quest: After solving the Tanner murders in the Bridge District, you will either get ambushed by the Wizard who helped the Tanner later in the same district (he drops information concerning the building and the Rogue Stone necessary to enter), or you go the Temple District, into the Guarded Compound, and battle the party there. On your way out, a Twisted Rune party will ambush you, revealing information if you have found Koshi's letter (2nd floor), or telling you to do so if not. The letter reveals that the building next to Delosar's Inn is suspicious. Head to that building in the Bridge District, enter through the door with a Rogue Stone found on the Tanner Mage's body or anywhere else, and defeat the Twisted Rune members inside.

Now, once you clear the Twisted Rune enclave, you will meet someone special and you will find clues about a similar enclave in Baldur's Gate, and evidence that link the Rune with the **Cowled Wizards**. The friend will also allow you to enter Baldur's Gate again after the events of SoD, assuming you can't at this point, which is the normal outcome in the EET if you've played through SoD. What you do next is up to you.

If you haven't done so already, your first option is to head to Baldur's Gate East, to the last house on the left, south-west of Sorcerous Sundries (the one with the rotting door). Stand next to the door with a Rogue Stone, and it should teleport you in the second enclave, similar to the Athkatla one. There, you will face either a hard battle, or a very hard battle. The very hard battle happens if you bribed the Cowled Wizards in Athkatla. Once they are dead, you will again meet your new friend and will now know who among the Cowled Wizards has dealings with the Twisted Rune. Which leads us to your second option...

Your second option is to investigate the Cowled Wizards directly. You won't get very far by just talking to them, so you really have to fight them until the end so that you get to battle their leaders. How to do this: simply cast spells anywhere outdoors in the city, and battle through their ranks until the bosses come out. You will fight the contact, who will flee. If you have Bribed the Cowled Wizards, the contact will instead appear in the Twisted Rune fight in Baldur's Gate. You can actually clear the Baldur's Gate enclave before the Athkatla one if you feel so inclined, as outlined above...

Basically, you can do this stuff out of order if you like. But if you bribe the Cowled Wizards in BG2, and have already cleared the BG enclave before doing so, you'll get stuck. My advice: don't bribe the Cowled Wizards if you have already cleared the BG enclave.

Regardless of the option you choose, you have to battle the contact and have them flee, either in Baldur's Gate or Athkatla, before you can continue. Anyway, now you have pissed off the Twisted Rune for real, and will be ambushed by them in several places, most notably Baldur's Gate (should you return). **But the only way to move forward with the quest at this point is to actually finish Shadows of Amn.**

### Throne of Bhaal

Now that you're in Throne of Bhaal, the next step of the quest will happen in **Amkethran**. Once you have entered from the South, go left, and you will be ambushed by the previously-mentioned contact, along with elite members of the Twisted Rune. This should be a dangerous fight even by ToB standards so come prepared, because they are. The contact will drop a special wardstone.

Go to the Graveyard District back in Athkatla, enter the Lower Tombs, go in the Crypts below (the ones filled with Undead) and go completely at the bottom of the map, in the room that was ransacked by tomb pillagers. Your friend will appear, telling you to hug the wall on the right (near the urns). Do that, with the wardstone in your inventory, and you will be transported to the last area and will have reached the last part of the quest, which I am not going to spoil. Good luck ^^

#### *Note*
There are other small details scattered throughout, but this is the core of the quest. This quest can be completed even if you start a game in BG2, and thus, can't ever go back to BG1 (how: complete Athkatla Twisted Rune encounter, fight Cowled Wizards until the end, then get ambushed in Amkethran and go back to Graveyard District. That's the gist of fast-forwarding through it.)
