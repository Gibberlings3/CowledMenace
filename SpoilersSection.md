#Spoilers Section

Don't read this if you don't want to get spoiled! One of the fun parts of this mod is having to investigate the Twisted Rune, which you won't have to do if you know exactly where to go, all the time. But if you're stuck, this is how to progress...

##Rough Walkthrough

*Optional* in BG1 </br>
Acquire a Rogue Stone (you can find one in South-east BG, Gantolandan's house) and head to Baldur's Gate East, to the last house on the left, south-west of Sorcerous Sundries (the one with the rotting door). Stand next to the door with a Rogue Stone, and it should teleport you in a Twisted Rune enclave, similar to the Athkatla one. There, you will face a hard battle, designed to be impossible to complete at this point outside of epic cheese strategies. Assuming you win, you will meet a friend afterwards who will point you toward Athkatla. This part is entirely optional as you can come back later to complete it. The quest is continued in BG2.
